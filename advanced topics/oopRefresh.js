// centered around objects, not functions

//4 pillars of oop

// ENCAPSULATION
// group related variables and functions operating on them into objects
// reduce complexity, inrease reusability

//ABSTRACTION
// hide the details and the complexity
// reduce the impact of change

//INHERITENCE
// eliminate redundant code

//POLYMORPHISM
// refacotr ugly switch/case statements, same function does different things
